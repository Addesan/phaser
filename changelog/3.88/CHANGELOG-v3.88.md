# Version 3.88 - Minami - in dev

## New Features

## Updates

* `Tween.isNumberTween` is a new boolean property that tells if the Tween is a NumberTween, or not.

## Bug Fixes

* `TweenData.update` will now check if the Tween is a Number Tween and apply the final start/end value to the result on completion, instead of the eased value as calculated by the change made in v3.87.
