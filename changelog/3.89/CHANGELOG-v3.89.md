# Version 3.89 - Tsugumi - in dev

## New Features

## Updates

* The `EXPAND` Scale Mode has been updated to now clamp the size of the canvas that is created, preventing it from growing too large on landscape ultra-wide displays. Fix #7027 (thanks @leha-games @rexrainbow)
* An Error will now be thrown if you try to create a DOM Game Object but haven't correctly configured the Game Config (thanks @samme)

## Bug Fixes

* An erroneous `console.log` was left in the Text Game Object. This has now been removed.
